# inkling

## What is inkling?
Inkling is an api wrapper for discord, made for fun!
This isn't meant for wide use, and if it does get used a lot, the library will get a redesign.

## Suggestions? 
Open a issue with the label `enhancement`, and follow the template!

## Notes
Inkling needs contributors! contact me (mojidev-py) at pycharmdudeig@gmail.com to become one!
Inkling uses the Gateway API to make it easier to implement code. The http api may be added in the future.
